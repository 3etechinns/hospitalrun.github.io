# Interested in Contributing to HospitalRun?
Currently, there are a few ways to contribute. As the project grows, they'll be more. We hope you catch the vision for what we're doing together and get involved in whatever way you can.

## Become a Code Contributor
HospitalRun is proudly built with technologies like [Ember](http://emberjs.com), [Node](http://nodejs.org), and [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/). If you work with those technologies already or have software development experience and are interested in learning them, consider [contributing to HospitalRun](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). If you're serious about contributing, we also encourage you to [join our Slack](https://hospitalrun-slackin.herokuapp.com/), where the majority of the project communication happens.

## Make a financial contribution to support the development and deployment of HospitalRun
Currently, the resources (financial and human) standing behind HospitalRun are coming from [CURE International](http://cure.org). 

[Founded in 1996](https://cure.org/about/history/) as a [US 501(c)3](http://cure.org/finances), CURE International is a network of hospitals and surgical programs around the world that focuses on the needs of children with surgically correctable disabilities and their families. 

CURE started HospitalRun to solve a problem for their network of hospitals and programs in [30 countries](http://cure.org/map). CURE open sourced HospitalRun because we share a vision that [thousands of other facilities around the world](http://goo.gl/NCJDnJ) could benefit from this work.

If you'd like to make a contribution to CURE International that will be used for the development and deployment of HospitalRun, CURE has set up an online donation form at the link below.
